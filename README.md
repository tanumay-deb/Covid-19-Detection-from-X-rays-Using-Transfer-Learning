# Covid-19 Detection from X-rays Using Transfer Learning

## Description
The Covid-19 pandemic has created a need for effective and accurate detection methods to help contain the spread of the virus, especially in areas where proper testing kits and technology are scarce. Rather than relying on guesswork or treating symptoms, this project aims to provide professionals with a head start in terms of quarantining and treatment by utilizing transfer learning with the VGG16 neural network architecture to detect Covid-19 from chest X-rays.

The VGG16 neural network is a pre-trained deep learning model widely used in computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this project, the VGG16 model was employed as the starting point for training a new model to detect Covid-19 from chest X-rays. A dataset consisting of chest X-rays from patients with Covid-19 and healthy patients was collected and used to train the VGG16 model, enabling it to distinguish between the two classes. The resulting model achieved a high accuracy rate of over 90% in identifying Covid-19 cases in the X-rays, demonstrating a higher efficiency with resource utilization when compared to a sequential CNN model.

This project holds the potential to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of Covid-19, particularly in areas where access to other testing methods may be limited. However, it is important to note that further testing and validation of the model are necessary before it can be widely implemented in clinical settings.

## Aim of the Proposed Work
The aim of the project is to create and train a non-biased dataset and detect Covid-19 positive X-rays using a convolutional neural network architecture that is less computationally heavy and time-consuming, while still providing highly accurate results. This project addresses the limitations of traditional CNN architectures in terms of computation and time constraints, as well as biased datasets. By leveraging transfer learning and compiling multiple datasets, this system aims to assist physicians in reaching conclusions more quickly and taking necessary actions against this highly infectious disease.

## Objectives of the Proposed Work
The objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Improve performance and training time by utilizing transfer learning for model training, thereby addressing the computational power requirements of neural networks used in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD).
2. Create an unbiased dataset by combining multiple datasets, as existing X-ray datasets tend to be biased with a higher proportion of normal pictures than infected pictures. This aims to reduce bias in predictions and improve the accuracy of the model.
3. Achieve a similar or higher accuracy compared to existing models, which typically yield around 85% accuracy. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately detect Covid-19 cases from chest X-rays, aiding in the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
